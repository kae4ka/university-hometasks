# What's that?
just some hometasks for my university. could be useful for beginners
- `INS.ipynb` for neural networks (just basic stuff such as MLP and SGD)
- `pandas.ipynb` speaks for itself and also contains a russian description for each task
- `pyspark_kmeans.ipynb` was one of homeworks last year. this notebook includes 2 parts: wine 🍷 clusterization using pyspark and kmeans and sparse matrices multiplication 📈 using pyspark and scipy
